This playbook will allow automating delivering TLS certificate/key pair as well as configuring client SSL profile associated with a Virtual IP within F5 BIG IP platform. The end result will provide TLS/SSL certificates at the F5 Load Balancer and allow SSL offloading for traffic destined to endpoints like Apache and NGINX webservers.
